Lua Expressions

Expressions should take the form:

x = x * 2 + 5;

x represents the "natural" value of the control before it has been processed, and is also the 
final output of the expression.

When defining functions to be called in a Lua expression, you will often want to pass the "natural"
value of hte control; since this value is represented with the variable x, one would just write:

expression = "log10(x)"

assuming log10 was the name of a function in Lua that accepted one numeric value as an argument.
